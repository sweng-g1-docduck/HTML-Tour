                                <p> The Quality Assurance Manual is used to ensure quality is maintained suring the project. The document is designed as reference for employees, clients and stakeholders.
                                        It is intended to ensure that high quality and consistent standards are adhered to throughout the  company's activities. The document establishes the framework for each role and their 
                                        responsibilities, the deliverables and project management and development methodologies </p>

                                <p>Each member of the group completed the section for their primary role. This ensures that they are understand the level of quality expected in their contributions to the project.  
                                        Each member has generated a list of risk managements and quality assurance metrics related to their individual responsibilites. This was to ensure a specific and measurable metric of quality. The QA Manual drafts were sent to the client for review and feedback was integrated for each draft. The final version was reviewed by the whole group and was updated after release</p>

                                <p>The Project Management Methodology serves as an important reference for the design and programming components of the project. It clearly lays out the specific method to be used for successful 
                                        implementation of agile development. This is to ensure that the programming created by each programmer is compatible with each other</p>

                                <p>The Function Specification outlines the functionality and requirements for the software. It is designed to lay out, in easy to understand terms, the specifics of the

                                <p>The Financial Business Plan outlines the financial goals and objectives for potential investors. It provides a detailed overview of the product, the company that will create it as well as the financial plans and strategies that will ensure the project meets its financial targets. The plan is designed to convince an investor to invest in the product and to give them the confidence and vision to support it.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The Financial Business Plan was completed largely by the Financial Managers with assistance from some other members.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>The Business Plan uses graphs and tables to lay out the required costs for completion of the project, breaking these down into week-by-week and cost-by-cost bases. This allows a potential investor to see an accurate and itemised vue of where and when costs are expected to occur.</p>
